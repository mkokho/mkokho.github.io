# Operational excellence

Design principles:
 - perform operations as code
 - annotated documentation
 - make frequent, small, reversible changes
 - refine operations procedures frequently
 - anticipate failure
 - learn from all operational failures

### Prepare
To prepare for operational excellence you have to understand your workloads and their expected behaviors. 

- choose priorities to align operational improvements with buisness need
- design workloads considering how it will be deployed, updated and operated
- create CI/CD pipelines for deployments
- collect logs and metrics
- tag resources
- write scripts for tasks in runbooks and playbooks
- share knowledge in the team about all workloads

### Operate

Operational success is the achievement of outcomes measured by the metrics you define.

- implement dashboards with buisness and technical viewpoints of the workloads
- automate responses to operational events
- perform root cause analysis

### Evolve

Implement frequent small incremental changes based on the lessons learned from your operations activities.

- provide time to learn from failures and experimentations
- plan improvements
- perform cross-teams reviews
- share knowledge across teams
