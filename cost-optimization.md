# Cost Optimization

Design principles:
 - adopt a consumption model
 - measure overall efficiency
 - stop spending money on data center operations
 - analyze and attribute expenditure
 - use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

### Cost-effective resources
Using the appropriate services, resources, and configurations for your workloads is key to cost savings. 

 - approprtiate provisioning
 - right sizing
  - monitoring must accurately reflect the end-user experience
  - compare cost of modification with benefit of right sizing
 - purchasing options
 - geographic selection
 - managed service
 - optimize data transfer 

### Matching supply and demand

Balance just-in-time supply with requirements for high-availability and provision time.

 - demand-based: leverage elasticity of the cloud by using metrics
   - understand speed of provisioning
   - understand the rate of change in demand
 - buffer-based: leverage queues
    - understand acceptable delay
    - plan to handle duplicate requests
 - time-based: leverage patterns in the demand
    - understand consistency of the pattern
    - understand impact of incorrect provisioning

### Usage and Expedenture Awareness
Understanding your business cost drivers is critical to managing your business expenditure effectively and identifying cost-reduction opportunities.

 - stakeholders need to be involved in usage and expenditure discussions
   - financial
   - buisness untis
   - tech leads
   - third parties
 - visibility will enable opportunities for savings
   - estimate and forecast
   - raise notifications
   - assess biggest investments
   - analyze spend and usage
   - reserved insntance utilization and coverage
 - cost attribution
   - account structuring
   - tagging
   - lifecycle

### Optimizing over time

- measure, monitor and improve by using metrics and goals
- review existing architectural decisiong to unsure they remain cost effective
